The types of the Java programming language are divided into two categories: primitive types and reference types. 
The primitive types are the boolean type and the numeric types. 
The numeric types are the integral types byte, short, int, long, and char, and the floating-point types float and double. 
The reference types are class types, interface types, and array types. 
There is also a special null type.



Data types in java:
    Primitive:
        boolean.
        numeric:
            integral:
                byte (8 bits).
                short (16 bits) / char (16 bits).
                int (32 bits).
                long (64 bits).
            floating-point:
                float: (32 bits).
                double: (64 bits).
    Reference:
        class.
        interface.
        array.




Primitive Data Types:

boolean: Represents a true/false value.

Numeric Data Types:
Integral:
byte (8 bits): Represents small integers.
short (16 bits) / char (16 bits):
short represents short integers.
char represents a character in Unicode.
int (32 bits): Represents integers.
long (64 bits): Represents large integers.

Floating-point:
float (32 bits): Represents single-precision floating-point numbers.
double (64 bits): Represents double-precision floating-point numbers.

Reference Data Types:
class: Represents user-defined types or objects.
interface: Defines a set of abstract methods that a class must implement.
array: Represents a collection of elements of the same type. Arrays can be of primitive or reference types.

It's important to note that primitive data types store values directly, 
while reference data types store references (memory addresses) to objects. 
Additionally, Java is a strongly-typed language, meaning that you need to declare the data type of a variable before using it.
