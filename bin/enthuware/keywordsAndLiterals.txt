1. Keywords: The Java language reserves the following 50 character sequences for use as keywords and cannot be used as identifiers. 
   These words are have a special meaning in the Java language and so they cannot be used as anything else such as variable names in your code.  
 
   abstract assert boolean break byte case catch char class const continue default do double else enum extends 
   final finally float for goto if implements import instanceof int interface long native new package private 
   protected public return short static strictfp super switch synchronized this throw throws transient try void 
   volatile while  
 
2. Reserved words: There is no special category of words by the name of reserved words. Keywords and reserved words mean the same thing. 
   So, all of the above are also "reserved words". Observe that the words const and goto are also included in the above list even though 
   they have no special meaning in the language.  
    
3. Literals: true and false might appear to be keywords, but they are technically boolean literals. 
   Similarly, while null might appear to be a keyword, it is technically the null literal. You cannot use literals as identifiers either.
